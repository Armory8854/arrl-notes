* Chapter Notes
** General History
- Marconi's first transmission was over the atlantic in 1901
- The first amateur licenses were granted in 1912 frog 
- As radio became more popular, the FCC was created to regulate it.
  + The Amateur service was created in 1934
    * Part of what makes the name "Amateur" is a clearly defined rule that precludes ham's from earning monetary compensation for their service.
- Ham's played a crucial role in WWII as operators and radio engineers [fn:3]
  + In postwar times, they turned their skills to electronics & engineering as a profession.
- By the 50's - 60's, global transmissions (or DX - will be covered later) was possible - and popular!


** Early Technology
- Early stations used sparks of electricity to create electromagnetic vibrations strong enough.
  + This was generally inefficient. And dangerous!
  + This was thankfully replaced by vacuum tube transmitters.
- By the 1920's both voice & morse were being transmitted.
- hams invented and utilized utilities like teletype (which is still important to this day).
- They even invented new forms of picture transmission - Slow Scan Television.
- The first satellite was built by amateurs, called the OSCAR-1
  + It was launched in 1961
- Through the 70's ham's built an extensive network of repeaters to provide long distance communications to low powered radio.
- In the 80's and 90's, microprocessors made radios much more powerful.
  + This also brought in multiple modes of digital communication, like packet radio

** Ham radio Today
- Nowadays, the internet & radio have combined in new ways.
  + Some examples include:
    * Wireless data networks
    * Position Reporting Systems
    * Radio based email [fn:4]
      - I'm very interested in this personally
- voice communications are bouncable between radio and the internet.
- Morse code is still alive and well thanks to it's simplicity & efficiency
- Keyboard communications are also possible via radio
- Improved satellites are now in orbit as well
- In times of emergency, Ham's are quick to provide their services

** What Do Hams Do?
*** Talking
- Hams use voice more than any other form of communication.
- Most ham radio are made for voice due to this.
- Thanks to repeaters, distances of 50 miles or more can be covered by even low powered radios.
- Some hams even bounce signals off the atmosphere to make contacts globally
- Computer to computer voice is possible via ham radio.

*** Byte-ing
- By connecting computers to a radio, digital information can be sent over the air.
- One example of this is 'keyboard-to-keyboard' communications.
- I suppose packet radio would fall under this as well

*** Sending
- Morse code!

*** Building
- you are encouraged to build & repair your own equipment.
- This leads to innovation and unique builds in general.

*** Watching
- Transmitting picture & video is possible as well.

** Emergency Communications & Public Service
*** Service
- Amateur radio enjoys it's airwave priviliges in large thanks to the emergency response assistance Ham's provide.
- Thanks to ham radio not depending on extensive support systems (AKA decentralized nature) it's able to help out quickly when other forms of communication go down.

*** Amateur Radio Clubs & Organizations
- Assisting newcomers is part of the amateur radio community nature
- You can find clubs on the ARRL's website, under the Affiliated Club Search
- Joining a club is a great way to get started

** What Makes Amateur Radio Different?
- While CB and FRS radios exist, amateur radio is different.
- What makes it different is variety
  + Specifically, with the types of signals and radio bands accessible.

** Unlicensed Personal Radios
- The most popular radios are FRS/GMRS handhelds.
  + These are limited to 22 channels
  + GMRS requires a license!
    * Without the license, your maximum 1/2 watt of transmitter output limits you to comms over a few hundred yards to a couple miles.
- CB, or citizens band, is commonly used
  + Mainly used in vehicles, boats, and farm equipment.
  + They have 40 channels, and communication is reliable over a range of several miles.
- Marine VHF is used on boats
  + These have up to 50 channels, mainly for short range.

** ARRL - The Nation Association for Amateur Radio
- The ARRL has been an integral part of Amateur Radio since the beginning
- They offer the largest number of Examiner Coordinators
- Also, they work on behalf of all hams with the FCC and Congress.
- The Core Missions of the ARRL are:
  + Public Service
    * The ARRL promotes the public service aspects of Amateur Radio.
  + Advocacy
    * The ARRL represents Amateur radio at the local, state, federal, and international levels.
  + Education
    * The educational mission of the ARRL is twofold:
      1. To recruit new amateurs.
         - The ARRL publishes book and study guides
         - Maintains a mentor program
         - And much more
      2. Promote ham radio in school classrooms, advocating its use as a tool to teach science & technology.
         - The ARRL assists teachers with appropriate instructional materials & training.
  + Technology
    * The ARRL promotes technical skills & training for all amateurs.
  + Membership
    * The ARRL offers membership opportunities with may benefits.
  + QST - The Amateur's Magazine
    * Members of the ARRL get this magazine full of articles & adveriting.

** Business & Public Safety Radio
- Policeman & firemen use handheld radios professionally.
- Even some business issue radios on the job.
- The FCC created radio services for public agencies & private businesses.
- These organizations, public and private, are all licensed.
- The radios are similar to ham radios, sometimes identical.
      
* Vocabulary
- Elmer [fn:1]
  + Someone who mentors a new amateur radio enthusaist.

  * Possibly derived from 'ham-fisted'
- CB
  + Citizens Band
- FRS
  + Family Radio Service
- GMRS
  + General Mobile Radio Service
- Homebrewing
  + The act of building, or repairing, your own equipment and accessories.
- ATV
  + Amateur Televisioin
- ARES
  + Amateur Radio Emergency Service
  + A Training program for emergency communications readiness.
- ITU
  + International Telecommunication Agency

[fn:1] - Possibly originates from a <1971-03-01 Mon> issue of QST magazine. It references an older man named Elmer, and an aspiring radio enthusiast said we could all use an Elmer in our life.
