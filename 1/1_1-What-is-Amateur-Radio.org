* Chapter Notes
** General History
- Marconi's first transmission was over the atlantic in 1901
- The first amateur licenses were granted in 1912 frog 
- As radio became more popular, the FCC was created to regulate it.
  + The Amateur service was created in 1934
    * Part of what makes the name "Amateur" is a clearly defined rule that precludes ham's from earning monetary compensation for their service.
- Ham's played a crucial role in WWII as operators and radio engineers [fn:3]
  + In postwar times, they turned their skills to electronics & engineering as a profession.
- By the 50's - 60's, global transmissions (or DX - will be covered later) was possible - and popular!


** Early Technology
- Early stations used sparks of electricity to create electromagnetic vibrations strong enough.
  + This was generally inefficient. And dangerous!
  + This was thankfully replaced by vacuum tube transmitters.
- By the 1920's both voice & morse were being transmitted.
- hams invented and utilized utilities like teletype (which is still important to this day).
- They even invented new forms of picture transmission - Slow Scan Television.
- The first satellite was built by amateurs, called the OSCAR-1
  + It was launched in 1961
- Through the 70's ham's built an extensive network of repeaters to provide long distance communications to low powered radio.
- In the 80's and 90's, microprocessors made radios much more powerful.
  + This also brought in multiple modes of digital communication, like packet radio

** Ham radio Today
- Nowadays, the internet & radio have combined in new ways.
  + Some examples include:
    * Wireless data networks
    * Position Reporting Systems
    * Radio based email [fn:4]
      - I'm very interested in this personally
- voice communications are bouncable between radio and the internet.
- Morse code is still alive and well thanks to it's simplicity & efficiency
- Keyboard communications are also possible via radio
- Improved satellites are now in orbit as well
- In times of emergency, Ham's are quick to provide their services

** What Do Hams Do?
*** Talking
- Hams use voice more than any other form of communication.
- Most ham radio are made for voice due to this.
- Thanks to repeaters, distances of 50 miles or more can be covered by even low powered radios.
- Some hams even bounce signals off the atmosphere to make contacts globally
- Computer to computer voice is possible via ham radio.

*** Byte-ing
- By connecting computers to a radio, digital information can be sent over the air.
- One example of this is 'keyboard-to-keyboard' communications.
- I suppose packet radio would fall under this as well

*** Sending
- Morse code!

*** Building
- you are encouraged to build & repair your own equipment.
- This leads to innovation and unique builds in general.

*** Watching
- Transmitting picture & video is possible as well.

* Vocabulary
- Elmer [fn:1]
  + Someone who mentors a new amateur radio enthusaist.
- HAM / Ham [fn:2]
  * The true answer is unknown.
  * Even before radio, telegraphers referred to poor operators as a 'ham'
  * Possibly derived from 'ham-fisted'
- CB
  + Citizens Band
- FRS
  + Family Radio Service
- Homebrewing
  + The act of building, or repairing, your own equipment and accessories.
- ATV
  + Amateur Televisioin

* Footnotes
[fn:1] - Possibly originates from a <1971-03-01 Mon> issue of QST magazine. It references an older man named Elmer, and an aspiring radio enthusiast said we could all use an Elmer in our life.
