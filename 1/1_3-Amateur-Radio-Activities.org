** Identification And Contacts
- On the airwaves, you identify with a /call sign/. [fn:1]
  + These are unique to every person with a license.
- By transmitting your call, other hams know who you are and your nationality
- Identifying yourself with your callsign is known as /signing/
  + In fact, it's mandatory to transmit your /callsign/ regularly during every contact to know who transmitted what.
- Any conversation made over the air is a /contact/
- Attempting to make contact by transmitting your /callsign/ is making a call, or /calling/.
- If you're making a "come in anybody" call to hear whoever can call, that's calling /CQ/ [fn:2]
  + Once you establish contact, the next step is to exchange more information such as a /signal report/.
  + Name and location are exchanged after that
- A long conversation is known as a /ragchew/
- At the end of the contact, you sign off.
