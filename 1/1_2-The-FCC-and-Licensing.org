* Chapter Notes
- The FCC is charged with admistering all radio signals transmitted by US radio stations
- The FCC also coordinates these transmissions with other countries

** Why Get A License?
- Amateurs may choose many types of radios and activities to participate in.
- However, licenses are there to ensure that all who participate understand the basics before transmitting.
  + This helps keep Amateur Radio useful & enjoyable for everyone.
- One of the most important benefits of being licensed is the right to be protected from interference by signals from unlicensed devices, such as consumer electronics.

** Licensing Overview
- The FCC has a different set of rules for each type of radio use.
  + These are called services (see the vocabulary for examples)
- Nearly all services require a license before transmissions can be made.
  + These are called licensed services, and the Amateur service is one example.
- Most services do not require an examination to be livensed.
  + This is because the FCC sets strict technical standards for the radio equipment used in these services.
    * Amateurs have a large variety of equipment available, so the knowledge to use the equipment is higher.

** Amateur Licenses
- At one point in time, the FCC gave license exams themselves.
- Nowadays, licenses are handled by amateurs that are VEC's
- There are currently 14 different clubs or organizations recognized as VEC's by the FCC.
- There are 3 types of licenses being granted today
  1. Technicial
  2. General
  3. Amateur Extra
