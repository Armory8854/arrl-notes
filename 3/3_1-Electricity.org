* Chapter Notes
** Current And Voltage
- Electric /current/ is the flow of /electrons/ [fn:T5A03]
  + /Current/ is represented by the symbol /i/ or /I/
  + /Electrons/ are negatively charged atomic particles.
- Current is measured in units of /amperes/. [fn:T5A01]
  + /amperes/ is abbreviated as /A/ or /amps/.
- Current is always measured as the flow through something, such as wires or electrical components.
  + An /ammeter/ is used to measure current [fn:T7D04]
- /Voltage/ is the /electromotive force/ or /electric potential/ that makes electrons move. [fn:T5A05]
  + Electrons move towards positive voltage differences.
  + Voltage is measured in units of /volts/, abbreviated /V/ or /v/
  + Voltage is measured with a /voltmeter/. [fn:T7D01]
  + Voltage is always measured from one point to another.
    * If the earth's surface is used as the reference voltage, it's called /earth ground/, /ground potential/, or just /ground/.
- /Polarity/ refers to the convention that determines which voltages are positive & negative.

** Direct And Alternating Current
- Currents that flow in one direction at all times are /direct currents/ (/dc/)
- Currents that regularly reverses direction is /alternating current/ (/ac/) [fn:T5A09].

/Direct Current (Top graph) flows steadily in one direction. Pulsaging directly from currents may stop and start, but always flow in the same direction (the orange line signifies the current flowing in the same direction). Alternating Currents (bottom graph) regularly reverse direction/

- Just like current, a voltage that has the same /polarity/ all the time is a /dc voltage/.
  + /polarity/ = The same direction from positive to negative voltage.
- A voltage that regularly reverses polarity is an /ac voltage/.

** Circuits
- A /circuit/ is any path through which current can flow
- Electrical circuits are made from /components/ and the connections between them.
- If two or more components, such as light bulbs, are connected in a ciircuit so that the same current must flow through all of them, that is a /series/ circuit. [fn:T5D13]
- If 2 or more components are connected so that the same voltage is present across all of them, that is a /parallel/ circuit. [fn:T5D14]
- A /short circuit/ is a direct connection, usually unintentional, between two points in a circuit.
- An /open circuit/ is made by breaking a current path in a circuit.

/Figure A shows 3 light bults and a battery connected in a *series*. The same current flows from the battery through all 3 light bulbs. Figure B shows the same bulbs and battery connected in a *parallel* circuit. The same voltage form the battery is applied across each light bulb./
