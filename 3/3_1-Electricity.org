* Chapter Notes
** Current And Voltage
- Electric /current/ is the flow of /electrons/ [fn:T5A03]
  + /Current/ is represented by the symbol /i/ or /I/
  + /Electrons/ are negatively charged atomic particles.
- Current is measured in units of /amperes/. [fn:T5A01]
  + /amperes/ is abbreviated as /A/ or /amps/.
- Current is always measured as the flow through something, such as wires or electrical components.
  + An /ammeter/ is used to measure current [fn:T7D04]
- /Voltage/ is the /electromotive force/ or /electric potential/ that makes electrons move. [fn:T5A05]
  + Electrons move towards positive voltage differences.
  + Voltage is measured in units of /volts/, abbreviated /V/ or /v/
  + Voltage is measured with a /voltmeter/. [fn:T7D01]
  + Voltage is always measured from one point to another.
    * If the earth's surface is used as the reference voltage, it's called /earth ground/, /ground potential/, or just /ground/.
- /Polarity/ refers to the convention that determines which voltages are positive & negative.

** Direct And Alternating Current
- Currents that flow in one direction at all times are /direct currents/ (/dc/)
- Currents that regularly reverses direction is /alternating current/ (/ac/) [fn:T5A09].

*Figure 3.1*

[[../img/3/figure-3_1.png]]

/Direct Current (Top graph) flows steadily in one direction. Pulsaging directly from currents may stop and start, but always flow in the same direction (the orange line signifies the current flowing in the same direction). Alternating Currents (bottom graph) regularly reverse direction/

- Just like current, a voltage that has the same /polarity/ all the time is a /dc voltage/.
  + /polarity/ = The same direction from positive to negative voltage.
- A voltage that regularly reverses polarity is an /ac voltage/.

** Circuits
- A /circuit/ is any path through which current can flow
- Electrical circuits are made from /components/ and the connections between them.
- If two or more components, such as light bulbs, are connected in a ciircuit so that the same current must flow through all of them, that is a /series/ circuit. [fn:T5D13]
- If 2 or more components are connected so that the same voltage is present across all of them, that is a /parallel/ circuit. [fn:T5D14]
- A /short circuit/ is a direct connection, usually unintentional, between two points in a circuit.
- An /open circuit/ is made by breaking a current path in a circuit.

*Figure 3.3 - B*

[[../img/3/figure-3_3_b.jpg]]

/Figure A shows 3 light bults and a battery connected in a *series*. The same current flows from the battery through all 3 light bulbs. Figure B shows the same bulbs and battery connected in a *parallel* circuit. The same voltage form the battery is applied across each light bulb./

- At the junction of two components in a series circuit (Figure 3.3 A), you can see the current is unchanged - the same throughout the circuit.
- If 2 components are connected in parallel, the current divides between them.
  + Evenly? I assume that depends on other components like resistors and such.
- When components are connected in parallel with a source of voltage, such as a battery a la figure 3.3 B, the voltage across each is equal.
  + Answer to the above question I had.
- When the components are connected in series with the source of voltage, a la Figure 3.2 A, the voltage divides between the components *depending on their type & value*.
- Voltmeters are connected in parallel with or 'across' a component or circuit to measure voltage [fn:T7D02]
- Ammeters and multimeters configured to measure current are connected in series with a component on a circuit [fn:T7D03]
  + To summarize both above test questions:
    * Voltmeters are parallel
    * Ammeters are series

*** Economies of Scale - The Multimeter
- The basic electrical test instruments are meters
  + Voltmeters
  + Ammeters
  + Ohmmeters
- All 3 of the above are combined in a /multimeter/, which measures all 3 electrical values of [fn:T7D07]
  + Voltage
  + Current
  + Resistance
- Multimeters are also referred to as:
  + /VOM/
    * Volt-Ohm Meter
  + /DVM/
    * Digital Volt Meter
- Trying to measure voltage, or connecting the probes to an energized circuit when the meter is set to measure resistance, is a common way to damage a multimeter [fn:T7D06] [fn:T7D11]
- Take note of the multimeters voltage rating before use.
  + Voltages beyond the rating can 'flashover' to other pieces of equipment. Or to you, the handler of the multimeter!
    * This creates a shoch hazard to you and your surroundings!
    * *Ensure that the voltmeter and leads are rated for use at the voltages to be measured!!!!* [fn:T0A12]
- If you are measuring the resistance of a circuit and the reading starts out low, but gradually incrases, that indicates the presence of a large-value discharged capacitor [fn:T7D10]

** Resistance & Ohms Law
*** Resistance
- All materials oppose the flow of electrons through them, whether in the form of /dc/ or /ac/ at power frequencies like 70 Hz or RF that we use for radio signals.
- This property is called /resistance/, represented by /R/.
  + Resistance is measured in ohms, represented by the greek letter omega /Ï‰/.
  + Resistance is measured with an /ohmmeter/, which must be connected to a component in parallel [fn:T5A04] [fn:T5A11]
- Materials in which electrons flow easily in response to voltage are /conductors/
  + Metals such as copper are good conductors. [fn:T5A07]
- Materials that resist the flow of electrons are /insulators/
  + Such as glass, ceramic, dry wood, paper, plastics, non-metals [fn:T5A08]

*** Ohm's Law
- Ohm's law states that the current through a material is directly proportional to the voltage across it, and inversely proportional to the material's resistance.
  + The higher the resistance, the lower the current.
- As an equation, Ohm's law is
  \begin{equation}
  I = E / R
  \end{equation}
  + It's also written as
    \begin{equation}
    I = V / R
    \end{equation}
    * Where V is Voltage
- If you know any two of /I/, /E/, or /R/, you can determine the missing quantity as follows:
  \begin{equation}
  I = E / R
  \end{equation}
  [fn:T5D01]

  \begin{equation}
  E = I x R
  \end{equation}
  [fn:T5D02]

  \begin{equation}
  R = E / I
  \end{equation}
  [fn:T5D03]

- Figure 3.5A is an easy way to remember ohm's law.
