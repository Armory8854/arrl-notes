* Chapter Notes
- First let's start with the /signals/ that travel back & forth between radios.
- All radio equipment is designed to generate, or manipulate, /radio signals/. [fn:1]
- A /radio wave/ begins at an /antenna/ that turns an electrical signal into radio waves that travel at the speed of light.
  + As the wave passes other antennas, it creates replicas of the original signal.
  + A radio then turns that back into voice, data, or Morse.
- The process of turning the transmitter's output signal into radio waves that leave the antenna is called /radiating/ or /radiation/.
  + Radiation from an antenna is not the same as /ionizing radioation/, which is radioactivity.

*** Metric Prefixes
- Radio uses the Metric system due to it's ability to cover wide ranges of numbers easily + it's easy to convert.
- Prefixes expand or shrink units, multiplying them by factors of 10.
- For example, /kilometer (km)/ is one thousand meters, and a /millimeter (mm)/ is one-thousandth of a meter.

*Table 2.1 - International System of Units (SI) - Metric Units*
| Prefix | Symbol  | Multiplication Factor     |
|--------+---------+---------------------------|
| Tera   | T       | 10^12 = 12 0's (Trillion) |
| Giga   | G       | 10^9 = 9 0's (Billion)    |
| Mega   | M       | 10^6 = 6 0's (Million)    |
| Kilo   | k       | 10^3 = 3 0's (Thousand)   |
| Hecto  | h       | 10^2 = 2 0's (Hundred)    |
| Deca   | da      | 10^1 = 1 0 (Tens)         |
| Deci   | d       | 10^-1 = 1 .0              |
| Centi  | c       | 10^-2 = 2 .0's            |
| Milli  | m       | 10^-3 = 3 .0's            |
| micro  | weird u | 10^-6 = 6 .0's            |
| Nano   | n       | 10^-9 = 9 .0's            |
| Pico   | p       | 10^-12 = 12 .0's          |

- The most relevant prefixes you'll encounter from the table above are:
  + Pico (p)
  + Nano (n)
  + Micro (u)
  + Milli (m)
  + Centi (c)
  + Kilo (k)
  + Mega (M)
  + Giga (G)
- The capitalization is important!

  + 2425 MHz = 2.425 GHz

** Frequency And Phase
- Like a water wave, a radio wave continually varies in strength or /amplitude/ like the sine wave shown in *Figure 2.1*.
- This continual change is called /oscillating/.
- As a signal oscilates, each up and down sequence is called a /cycle/.
- The number of /cycles per second/ is called a signal's /frequency/, represented by a lower-case /f/ [fn:T5A12].
  + The unit of measurement for frequency is /hertz/, abbreviated Hz [fn:T5A06]
- The /period/ of the cycle, /T/, is the duration.
  + The reciprocal of the period, 1/T, is the signams frequency, /f/
- 1 cycle per second is one hertz, or 1 Hz.
- As frequency increases, it's easier to use units like kilohertz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz), megahertz (1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz), and gigahertz (1 GHz, 1,000,000,000 Hz). [fn:T5C07] [fn:T5C13]

*** For More Information
- A /harmonic/ is a signal with a frequency that is a multiple (x2, x3) of a /fundamental/ frequency.
- The harmonic that is twice the fundamental's frequency is called the /second harmonic/
  + thrice the fundamental frequency is called the /third harmonic/
  + And so on
- There is no "First harmonic".
- Every cycle of the signal has the same basic shape:
  + Rising, falling, and returning where it started.
- Position in a cycle is called a /phase/.
  + Phase is used to compare how sine wave signals are aligned in time.
  + Phase is measured in /degrees/ and there are 360 degrees in one cycle of a sine wave.
  + If 2 sine waves have a phase difference of 180 degrees so that one wave is increasing while the other is decreasing, they are /out of phase/.
  + Waves that have no phase difference so that they are increasing and decreasing at the same time are /in phase/.

** The Radio Spectrum
- If connected to a speaker, signals below 20 kHz produce sound waves we can hear, so we call them /audio frequency/, or /AF/ signals.
- Signals that have a frequency over 20,000 Hz (20 kHz) are /radio frequency/ or /RF/ signals. [fn:T5C06]
- The range of radio signal frequencies is called the /radio spectrum/.
  + It starts at 20 kHz and continues through several hundred GHz, a thousand million times higher!

*Table 2.2 - RF Spectrum Ranges*
| Range Name                      | Abbreviation | Freq. Range      |
|---------------------------------+--------------+------------------|
| Very Low Frequency              | VLF          | 3 kHz - 30 kHz   |
| Low Frequency                   | LF           | 30 kHz - 300 kHz |
| Medium Frequency                | MF           | 300 kHz - 3 MHz  |
| High Frequency [fn:T3B10]       | HF           | 3 MHz - 30 MHz   |
| Very High Frequency [fn:T3B08]  | VHF          | 30 MHz - 300 MHz |
| Ultra High Frequency [fn:T3B09] | UHF          | 300 MHz - 3 GHz  |
| Super High Frequency            | SHF          | 3 GHz - 30 GHz   |
| Extremely High Frequency        | EHF          | 30 GHz - 300 GHz |

- A specific range of frequencines in which signals are used for a common purpose are called a /band/.
  + The AM Broadcast band extends from 535 to 1700 kHz
  + the FM Broadcast band covers 88 to 108 MHz
- Bands used by hams are called /amateur/ham bands/

*** For More Information
- Frequencies above 1 GHz are considered /microwaves/.
  + Microwave ovens operate at 2.4 GHz
    * So does wifi if I'm right? some of it anyways.
- Hams primarily use frequencies in the /MF/ (Medium Frequency) through /UHF/ (Ultra High Frequency) and Microwave ranges, but have 2 bands in the /LF/ (Low Frequency) range as well.
