* Chapter Notes
** Basic Station Organization
- The 3 basic elements of any amateur station are:
  1. /Transmitter/
     - Abbreviated /XMTR/
     - Generates a signal that carries speech, /Morse/, or data.
  2. /Receiver/
     - Abbreviated /RCVR/
     - Recovers speech, /Morse/, or data from a signal.
       + That signal originates from a /Transmitter/.
  3. Antenna
     - Turns radio signals from a transmitter into energy that travels through space as a radio wave.
     - Antennas capture radio waves & turn them into signals for a receiver to use.
     - A /feed line/ connects the antenna to the transmitter or receiver.
       + /feed lines/ are also called /transmission lines/, just like power lines.
       + A /transmit-receive (TR) Switch/ allows a transmitter and receiver to share a single antenna.
- Most ham equipment combines the transmitter and receiver into a single piece of equipment called a /transceiver/ [fn:T7A02]
  + Abbreviated /XCVR/
  + Also called /rigs/
    * I.E. a transciever intended for mounting in a vehicle is a /mobile rig/

** Repeaters
- /Repeaters/ are receivers+transmitter combos that re-transmit the info from a received signal simultaneously on another frequency or channel [fn:T1F09].
  + This action of receiving and transmitting is known as /duplex communication/
- Figure 2.7 shows the basic elements of a repeater station.
  + Because a repeater receives and transmits at the same time, it does not use a /TR Switch/, it uses a /duplexer/.

*Figure 2.7*

/In a repeater, the receivers output is immediately retransmitted by the transmitter on a different frequency. The duplexer allows the transmitter and receiver to share a common antenna at the same time./

- Repeaters provide local and regional comms for low powered mobile & portable stations.
  + Repeaters jobs are to provide strong low noise signals that everyone can hear, especially in times of crisis.
